# nRF WiFi Provisioning via We Bluetooth

This is a minimal example of how to provision an nRF7002 WiFi device using Web Bluetooth and React.

To test this project, you can program a [nRF7002DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF7002-DK) with the [MQTT example](https://www.zephyrproject.org/implementing-mqtt-over-wi-fi-on-the-nrf7002-dev-kit/).

The Zephyr blog has a [good getting started guide.](https://www.zephyrproject.org/implementing-mqtt-over-wi-fi-on-the-nrf7002-dev-kit/)
